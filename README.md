I develop projects that are for school and for fun too. I encourage everyone to build on what I have already made, and create something better.

I am an aspiring aerospace engineer, and hope to contribute to computational aerodynamics, be it from the design of autonomous systems (control theory) to the aerodynamic optimisation of flight systems. 

My skillsets:
- Data science
- Android dev
- Machine learning

Here are the things that I want to pick up:
- Database
- iOS dev
- Web dev

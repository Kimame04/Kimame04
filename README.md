### Welcome to Kimame04's GitHub profile!

I do projects that are for school and for fun too. I encourage everyone to build on what I have already made, and create something better! 

I'm still learning and always will be, but I have some experience doing the following:
- Data Science via `python`
- Android App Dev via `java`/`kotlin`
- Machine Learning via `python

### Welcome to Kimame04's GitHub profile!

I develop projects that are for school and for fun too. I encourage everyone to build on what I have already made, and create something better! 

My skillsets:
- Data science using `python`
- Android app dev using `java` or `kotlin`
- Machine learning using `python`

Here are the things that I want to pick up:
- Database using `SQL`
- iOS app dev using `swift`
- Web dev
